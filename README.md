# Canvas REST API
A sandbox for me to test the Canvas REST API.
I will do my best to clearly document my progress with exploring the API. Additionally, I will be saving exploratory reports inwhich I attempt to diagnose Canvas/LTI issues and propose solutions.

**NOTE:**  
This is not supposed to be a tutorial for other users. This repo is just a documentation of my testings in the test enviroment. All confidential information (api keys)  has been hidden in the .gitignore.
